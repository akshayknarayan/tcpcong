Query the `tcp:tcp_probe` tracepoint for congestion control information about the specified flows. Graph the output and optionally write it to a file.

Also provides `cctrace`, which attaches a kretprobe to the `tcp_ack` function to log more granular TCP flow information. The idea place to log would be `tcp_cong_control`, but that function gets inlined and is hard to attach to.
